## 📋 GENERAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS

### Documentation Requirements
- Always review existing documentation before starting
- Update relevant docs after completing work
- Maintain cross-references between documents
- Keep PRD synchronized with implementation

### Environment-Specific Rules

**Local Development (AI Agents)**
- ✅ Code development, test creation, documentation
- ✅ Git operations, file management
- ❌ Cannot test hardware directly
- ❌ Cannot access MQTT, sensors, relays
- ❌ Cannot manage systemd services

**Raspberry Pi (User Execution)**
- All hardware testing must be done on actual device
- User executes commands provided by agents
- User reports results back to agents
- AI agents analyze results and guide next steps

### Communication Between Agents

When one agent needs to hand off to another:
```
"Based on this [requirements/architecture/tests/implementation], 
I'm handing off to @[next-agent] to [next task]. Here's what they need to know:
[Summary of relevant information]"
```

### Project-Specific Context

**System**: Solar heating control system for Raspberry Pi
**Key Technologies**: Python, MQTT, systemd, Home Assistant integration
**Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, relays, temperature sensors
**Constraints**: Real-time sensor monitoring, service reliability
**Testing**: Must test hardware directly on Raspberry Pi

---

## 🎯 HOW TO USE THESE AGENTS

### Starting a Conversation

**For complex features (Recommended - Let Manager orchestrate):**
"@manager I want to add [feature description]"

**For workflow improvements:**
"@coach Our current workflow for [process] feels inefficient. Can you help?"

**For new features (Direct agent access):**
"@requirements I want to add [feature description]"

**For architecture review:**
"@architect Can you review the current system and suggest improvements for [area]?"

**For testing:**
"@tester I need comprehensive tests for [feature]"

**For implementation:**
"@developer The tests are written, please implement [feature]"

**For validation:**
"@validator Can you help me validate that [feature] works correctly?"

### Multi-Agent Session

**Option 1: Let Manager orchestrate (Recommended for complex tasks):**
"@manager I need to add a new feature: [description]"
- Manager will coordinate all agents automatically

**Option 2: Direct agent coordination:**
"I need to add a new feature. Let's start with @requirements, then move to @architect, @tester, and @developer"

**Option 3: Request workflow coaching:**
"@coach I'm having trouble with [workflow aspect]. Can you help improve it?"

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Use @manager for complex tasks** - Let the manager orchestrate workflows for multi-step features
2. **Always specify which agent** you need at the start of conversation
3. **Don't skip agents** in the flow unless it's a very minor change
4. **Each agent stays in their role** - no coding from Requirements agent, no requirements gathering from Developer agent
5. **Hand-offs are explicit** - agents clearly pass work to the next agent
6. **Documentation is continuous** - all agents update docs as they work
7. **Testing is mandatory** - always follow TDD principles
8. **Hardware testing on Raspberry Pi** - no simulated hardware tests
9. **Use @coach for workflow improvements** - Regular retrospectives help optimize the process

## 🎯 AGENT SELECTION GUIDE

**Not sure which agent to use?**

| Your Situation | Use This Agent |
|----------------|----------------|
| Complex feature with multiple steps | @manager |
| Process feels inefficient | @coach |
| Just starting, need to define what to build | @requirements |
| Need technical design for a solution | @architect |
| Need to write tests before coding | @tester |
| Ready to implement with tests written | @developer |
| Need deep code review (critical features) | @reviewer |
| Need to verify it works (code + hardware) | @validator |
| General question or unclear | Just ask - I'll route you |

**When to use @reviewer vs @validator:**
- **@validator** (always): Two-phase validation - code review + hardware testing
- **@reviewer** (optional): Deep independent review for critical/complex features only
- Most features use @validator only; @reviewer adds extra scrutiny when needed

---

**Default Behavior**: 
- If no agent is specified, I'll act as @manager and determine which agent(s) you need
- For simple requests, I may act as the appropriate agent directly
- For complex requests, I'll create a project plan and coordinate agents
