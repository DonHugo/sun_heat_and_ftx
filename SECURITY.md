# Security Policy

## 🔒 **Security for Solar Heating System**

This document outlines the security policy for the Solar Heating System project, including how to report vulnerabilities and our commitment to security.

## 🚨 **Supported Versions**

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v3.x    | ✅ Yes            |
| v2.x    | ⚠️ Limited       |
| v1.x    | ❌ No             |

## 🐛 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

### **For Critical Security Issues:**
If you discover a **critical security vulnerability** that could:
- **Compromise the heating system safety**
- **Allow unauthorized access to the system**
- **Cause physical damage or safety hazards**
- **Expose sensitive data**

**Please report it immediately** using one of these methods:

### **📧 Contact Methods:**
- **Email**: [Your security email]
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the repository
- **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers privately

### **📋 What to Include:**
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** on the system
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### **⏱️ Response Timeline:**
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours
- **High severity**: 3-5 business days
- **Medium/Low severity**: 1-2 weeks

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### **For Developers:**
- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Review code** before merging
- **Test security changes** thoroughly

### **For Users:**
- **Keep the system updated** with latest versions
- **Use strong passwords** for system access
- **Monitor system logs** for unusual activity
- **Report suspicious behavior** immediately

## 🔧 **Security Features**

### **Implemented Security Measures:**
- **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates
- **Code scanning** for vulnerability detection
- **Branch protection** rules for code quality
- **Environment variable** management
- **Secure MQTT** communication (when configured)

### **Planned Security Enhancements:**
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD
- **Security audit** workflows
- **Dependency vulnerability** monitoring
- **Code quality** gates

## 🤝 **Responsible Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report privately** to maintainers first
2. **Allow reasonable time** for fixes (typically 90 days)
3. **Coordinate disclosure** with maintainers
4. **Credit researchers** appropriately
5. **Document fixes** in security advisories
