# Collaboration Workflow

This document defines the standard process for working together on the solar heating system project.

## üéØ **Our Approach: Requirements First, Implementation Second**

We follow a structured approach to ensure we build exactly what you need:

### **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering & Discussion** üìù
**NO CODING YET** - We discuss and plan first

1. **Requirements Description**
   - You describe what you want to achieve
   - What problems you're trying to solve
   - What outcomes you expect

2. **Open Discussion**
   - We explore different approaches
   - Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
   - Consider existing system constraints
   - Identify potential challenges

3. **Clarification & Questions**
   - I ask clarifying questions to understand your needs
   - We discuss technical details and options
   - Make sure we're on the same page

4. **Solution Planning**
   - Outline the proposed approach
   - Define what will be built
   - Identify integration points
   - Plan implementation steps

5. **Agreement & Approval**
   - Confirm the approach meets your needs
   - Get your approval before any coding begins
   - Set expectations for timeline and deliverables

### **Phase 2: Implementation** üîß
**ONLY AFTER AGREEMENT** - Then we build

6. **Implementation**
   - Follow the agreed-upon plan
   - Build incrementally
   - Test as we go
   - Keep you updated on progress

7. **Review & Refinement**
   - Show you what was built
   - Get feedback and make adjustments
   - Ensure it meets your expectations

## ü§ù **Communication Guidelines**

### **What You Should Do:**
- Describe your requirements clearly
- Ask questions if something isn't clear
- Provide feedback on proposed solutions
- Let me know if the approach doesn't feel right

### **What I Will Do:**
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing
- Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
- Explain technical decisions
- Get your approval before coding
- Keep you informed of progress

### **What We Both Agree To:**
- No rushed implementations
- Clear communication about requirements
- Discussion before coding
- Iterative feedback and improvement

## üìã **Template for New Requirements**

When you have a new requirement, please include:

```
**Requirement:** [Brief description]

**Problem:** [What problem are you trying to solve?]

**Desired Outcome:** [What do you want to achieve?]

**Context:** [Any relevant background information]

**Constraints:** [Any limitations or preferences]

**Questions:** [Any specific questions you have]
```

## üîÑ **Example Workflow**

### **Good Example:**
1. **You:** "I want to monitor water usage patterns to detect leaks"
2. **Discussion:** We talk about different approaches (flow sensors, pressure monitoring, usage patterns)
3. **Clarification:** I ask about your existing sensors, what constitutes a "leak", etc.
4. **Planning:** We agree on monitoring usage patterns and alerting on unusual spikes
5. **Approval:** You confirm this approach works for you
6. **Implementation:** I build the leak detection system

### **What We Avoid:**
- Jumping straight into coding without understanding requirements
- Building features that don't solve your actual problems
- Making assumptions about what you want
- Implementing without your approval

## üìÅ **Documentation Standards**

### **For Each Feature:**
- **Requirements Document**: What we're building and why
- **Technical Design**: How it will work
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach
- **Testing Strategy**: How we'll verify it works
- **User Guide**: How to use the new feature

### **File Naming:**
- `REQUIREMENTS_[feature_name].md` - Requirements and discussion
- `DESIGN_[feature_name].md` - Technical design
- `IMPLEMENTATION_[feature_name].md` - Implementation details
- `USER_GUIDE_[feature_name].md` - How to use the feature

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

A successful collaboration means:
- ‚úÖ You get exactly what you need
- ‚úÖ No wasted time on wrong solutions
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of what was built
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain and extend
- ‚úÖ Both of us are satisfied with the process

## üìû **When to Break the Process**

The only times we might skip the full discussion:
- **Bug fixes**: Quick fixes for obvious issues
- **Minor tweaks**: Small adjustments to existing features
- **Emergency fixes**: Critical system issues

But even then, we'll discuss the approach briefly before implementing.

**Remember:** This document is a living guide. We can update it based on our experience working together. The goal is to make sure we build the right things, the right way, every time.

**Next Steps:** 
1. Review this workflow
2. Let me know if you'd like any changes
3. Use this process for future requirements
4. Keep this document updated as we learn what works best
