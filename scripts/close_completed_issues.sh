# Issue #31: Remove Flask Web Interface
echo "=== Closing Issue #31: Remove Flask Web Interface ===" 
gh issue close 31 --comment "‚úÖ Completed: Flask web interface removed from the system.

Changes made:
- Separate Flask web interface removed
- Cleanup script created: \`scripts/cleanup_flask_interface.sh\`
- Only REST API remains (uses Flask as framework, not web interface)
- New static frontend serves all UI needs

Note: \`api_server.py\` still uses Flask, but only as a REST API framework (not a web interface with templates). This is correct - we need Flask for the API but not for serving web pages.

The old Flask-based web interface is gone, replaced by static HTML/JS + REST API architecture."
