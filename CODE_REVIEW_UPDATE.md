# ✅ Code Review System Implemented!

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Update:** Added code review to multi-agent workflow  
**Agents Updated:** @validator (enhanced), @reviewer (new, optional)

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
```
@developer → Implementation
     ↓
@validator → Hardware testing only
     ↓
Done
```

**Problem:** No code review before hardware testing meant architectural issues and code quality problems weren't caught until later (or at all).

---

### After
```
@developer → Implementation + Self-Review Checklist
     ↓
[@reviewer] → Deep code review (CRITICAL features only - 10%)
     ↓
@validator → PHASE 1: Code Review
     ↓
@validator → PHASE 2: Hardware Testing
     ↓
Done
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Code reviewed BEFORE hardware testing
- ✅ Architecture compliance verified
- ✅ Code quality checked
- ✅ Issues caught early
- ✅ Minimal time added (5-10 min per feature)

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Standard Features (Most Cases)

Just use the normal flow. @validator now automatically does code review before hardware testing:

```
@manager I want to add [feature]
```

Or:

```
@requirements I want to add [feature]
```

**@validator will:**
1. Review your code first
2. Approve for hardware testing (or request changes)
3. Then test on hardware

---

### For Critical Features

Tell @manager it's critical:

```
@manager I need to add [critical feature] to the watchdog system. 
This is security-sensitive and needs thorough review.
```

**@manager will:**
1. Route through normal flow
2. Add @reviewer for deep review
3. Then @validator for validation

Or directly invoke @reviewer:

```
@reviewer Please review this authentication implementation for 
security vulnerabilities and architecture compliance.
```

---

## ✅ Developer Checklist

**Before handing off to @validator, you MUST:**

1. Complete self-review checklist
2. Verify all items are checked
3. Document any items not met
4. Ensure ready for code review

The checklist is in `IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md` and includes:
- Architecture compliance (6 items)
- Code quality (9 items)
- Documentation (6 items)
- Testing (6 items)
- Error handling (6 items)
- Logging (6 items)
- Security (6 items)
- Performance (6 items)
- Best practices (6 items)
- Integration (5 items)
- Readiness (4 items)

**Total:** 66 checkpoint items

## 💡 When to Use @reviewer

### USE @reviewer for:
✅ Main system files (main_system.py, watchdog, etc.)  
✅ Authentication/authorization code  
✅ Data encryption/security  
✅ Complex algorithms  
✅ Performance-critical loops  
✅ Database schema changes  
✅ API security changes  
✅ Major refactoring (>500 lines)  
✅ When @manager flags it as critical  

### DON'T use @reviewer for:
❌ Simple feature additions  
❌ UI changes  
❌ Configuration updates  
❌ Documentation changes  
❌ Test additions  
❌ Simple bug fixes  
❌ Logging additions  

**Rule of thumb:** If you're unsure, let @manager decide or just use @validator (it's usually enough).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this slow down development?**  
A: Slightly (~5-10 min per feature), but saves 30-60 min per bug prevented. Net positive after ~5 features.

**Q: Do I have to use @reviewer?**  
A: No! @reviewer is optional for critical features only. @validator's code review is enough for 90% of features.

**Q: What if I skip the self-review checklist?**  
A: @validator will likely find more issues, meaning more back-and-forth. Checklist saves time.

**Q: Can I still go directly to @validator?**  
A: Yes! @validator now just does two phases instead of one. The flow is the same.

**Q: What makes a feature "critical"?**  
A: Security-sensitive, core system, complex algorithm, or when @manager flags it as needing extra scrutiny.

**Q: How do I know if my feature needs @reviewer?**  
A: Ask @manager or look at the checklist in this doc. When in doubt, let @validator decide if @reviewer is needed.
