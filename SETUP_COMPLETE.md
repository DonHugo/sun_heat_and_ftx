## 🚀 How to Start Using It

### For Your Next Complex Feature:
```
@manager I want to [describe your feature]
```

The manager will automatically:
1. Create a project plan
2. Route to requirements agent
3. Route to architect
4. Route to tester (TDD)
5. Route to developer
6. Route to validator
7. Track progress and ensure completion

---

### For Quick Changes:
```
@requirements I want to [simple change]
```
Then manually work with agents as needed.

---

### To Improve Your Workflow:
```
@coach Our [process] feels slow, can you help?
```

The coach will analyze and recommend improvements.

---

## 🎯 Recommended First Steps

### 1. **Try the Manager** (Next Time You Build Something)
```
@manager I need to add [feature you've been thinking about]
```

Let the manager orchestrate the entire flow. Experience how it coordinates all agents.

### 2. **Do a Retrospective with Coach**
```
@coach Review our recent development workflow and suggest improvements
```

Get personalized recommendations for your project.

### 3. **Read the Guide**
Open `MULTI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed examples and best practices.

---

## 💡 Key Benefits

### With Manager:
✅ Never skip important steps  
✅ Automatic progress tracking  
✅ Smooth agent handoffs  
✅ Clear project plans  

### With Coach:
✅ Continuously improving workflows  
✅ Identify bottlenecks early  
✅ Learn best practices  
✅ Optimize over time  

### Overall System:
✅ Higher quality code  
✅ Fewer bugs (TDD)  
✅ Better documentation  
✅ Faster development (less rework)  
✅ Clear process

## 📚 Documentation Hierarchy

**Start Here:**
1. `AGENTS_README.md` - Quick overview and decision guide
2. `MULTI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide with examples
3. `.cursorrules` - Technical definitions (for reference)
4. Templates - Use when agents generate documents

---

## 🎓 Tips for Success

### 1. **Trust the Manager**
For complex features, let @manager orchestrate. It ensures quality.

### 2. **Use Coach Regularly**
After major features, ask @coach to analyze. Continuous improvement!

### 3. **Don't Skip Agents**
Each agent serves a purpose. Skipping = lower quality.

### 4. **Test on Hardware**
Always test on actual Raspberry Pi. @validator will guide you.

### 5. **Start Simple**
Begin with a small feature to learn the system.

## 🔄 Example First Task

Try this to learn the system:

```
@manager I want to add a simple test feature that logs "Hello from 
multi-agent system" when the system starts. Walk me through the 
entire process from requirements to validation.
```

This will give you hands-on experience with:
- How manager coordinates agents
- Requirements gathering
- Architecture design
- Test-driven development
- Implementation
- Hardware validation

---

## ❓ Questions?

**Not sure which agent to use?**
→ Just ask your question. The system defaults to @manager behavior.

**Want to learn more about an agent?**
→ Open `MULTI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` and read the "How to Use Each Agent" section.

**Want to see the technical details?**
→ Open `.cursorrules` to see all agent definitions and workflows.

**Want to improve the system?**
→ Use `@coach` regularly. It will help evolve the system for your needs.
