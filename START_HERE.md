## 🔥 Critical Issues to Fix First

After running the scripts, these are your top priorities:

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must fix before production)
1. Input validation missing
2. MQTT authentication gaps
3. Hardcoded secrets in config
4. Energy calculation bug (#19)

### 🟠 HIGH (Fix this week)
5. Error messages leak system info
6. No rate limiting on API
7. Memory leak in long-running process
8. TaskMaster crashes system
9. Sensor errors not handled
10. MQTT connection stability (#20)

---

## 🤖 Using Multi-Agent System

### Automatic Issue Creation

**Just say:**
```
@requirements [your need]
```

**Examples:**

```
@requirements I need to fix the input validation security issue
```
→ Updates issue, creates architecture, tests, implements, validates

```
@requirements I found a bug: pump runs at night when it shouldn't
```
→ Creates GitHub issue automatically with all details

```
@requirements I want to add weather forecasting for predictive heating
```
→ Creates feature issue, gathers requirements, starts workflow

**Time savings:** 80% faster than manual process!
