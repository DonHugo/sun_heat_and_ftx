## 🚀 How to Execute

### Using Multi-Agent System

For each issue, follow this workflow:

```
1. @requirements - Understand the problem completely
2. @architect - Design the solution
3. @tester - Write failing tests
4. @developer - Implement the fix
5. @validator - Verify on hardware
```

### Starting with Issue #43 (First Critical)

```
@requirements I need to fix issue #43 - API Input Validation Missing.

The API endpoints in api_server.py lack proper input validation. We need to:
1. Add pydantic models for all API endpoints
2. Validate all input parameters (types, ranges, required fields)
3. Return clear validation errors (400 Bad Request)
4. Prevent injection attacks and system crashes from bad input
5. Test with malicious inputs

Current endpoints that need validation:
- POST /api/control - System control commands
- PUT /api/mode - Mode changes
- POST /api/mqtt - MQTT operations
- Any other endpoints accepting user input

This is CRITICAL for security before production deployment.
