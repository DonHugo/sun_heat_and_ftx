        # Generates realistic temperatures based on:
        # - Time of day (6 AM to 6 PM = daylight)
        # - Weather conditions (sunny/cloudy/rainy)
        # - Seasonal variations (summer/winter)

```python
class ProductionMQTTTest:
    def connect(self):
        # Connects to production broker 192.168.0.110:1883
        # Tests publishing and subscription
        # Validates QoS levels
        # Tests failure scenarios
```
