# Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Purpose:** Catch issues before they reach production  
**When to Use:** Before every commit that will be deployed to Raspberry Pi  
**Mandatory:** YES - No exceptions!

## üîç Phase 1: Local Code Validation

### Syntax Check (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Check syntax of modified files
python3 -m py_compile python/v3/main_system.py
python3 -m py_compile python/v3/api_server.py
python3 -m py_compile python/v3/api_models.py

# Or check all Python files
find python/v3 -name "*.py" -exec python3 -m py_compile {} \;
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

### Import Check
```bash
# Test that all imports work
cd python/v3
python3 -c "from api_server import create_api_server; print('‚úÖ OK')"
python3 -c "from api_models import ControlRequest; print('‚úÖ OK')"
python3 -c "import main_system; print('‚úÖ OK')"
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

### Linting (if time permits)
```bash
pylint python/v3/api_server.py
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] SKIP / [ ] FAIL

---

## üîß Phase 2: Environment Verification

### Check Production Python Environment
```bash

‚úÖ Required packages installed
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

### Verify Dependencies
```bash
# Check all requirements.txt dependencies are available
./scripts/verify_deps.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ All dependencies satisfied
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

### Test with Production Python (if accessible)
```bash
# SSH to Pi and test imports
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "cd ~/solar_heating/python/v3 && \
  /opt/solar_heating_v3/bin/python3 -c 'import flask; import pydantic; print(\"‚úÖ OK\")'"
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] SKIP / [ ] FAIL

### Installation Command for Production
```bash
/opt/solar_heating_v3/bin/pip3 install <package> --break-system-packages
```

**Status:** [ ] N/A / [ ] DOCUMENTED

---

## üß™ Phase 5: Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd python/v3
pytest tests/
```

**Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] SKIP / [ ] FAIL

### Integration Tests (if applicable)

## üîÑ Phase 6: Rollback Preparation

### Rollback Plan
**Last Known Good Commit:** _______________

```bash
# Know how to rollback if needed
git log --oneline -5
```

**Rollback Commands:**
```bash
# On local machine
git checkout <commit-hash> python/v3/main_system.py
git commit -m "Rollback: <reason>"
git push

# On Raspberry Pi
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "cd ~/solar_heating && git pull && \
  sudo systemctl restart solar_heating_v3.service"
```

**Status:** [ ] DOCUMENTED

## üí° Tips

1. **Use this checklist for EVERY production deployment**
2. **Don't skip steps to save time** - they save time by preventing issues
3. **If unsure, ask** - better to ask than to break production
4. **Document issues found** - improve the process continuously
5. **Automate what you can** - scripts in `/scripts/` directory
