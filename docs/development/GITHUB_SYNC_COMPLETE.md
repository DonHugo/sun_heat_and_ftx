## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Create Labels (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/hafs/Documents/Github/sun_heat_and_ftx
chmod +x scripts/create_github_labels.sh
./scripts/create_github_labels.sh
```

This creates all 40+ labels in your GitHub repository.

---

### Step 2: Create Milestones (2 minutes)
```bash
# v3.1 - Bug Fixes & Stability
gh api repos/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx/milestones \
  -f title='v3.1 - Bug Fixes & Stability' \
  -f due_on='2025-12-01T00:00:00Z' \
  -f description='Critical bug fixes and system stability improvements'

# v3.2 - Enhanced Monitoring
gh api repos/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx/milestones \
  -f title='v3.2 - Enhanced Monitoring' \
  -f due_on='2026-02-01T00:00:00Z' \
  -f description='Improved monitoring, alerting, and error recovery'

# v3.3 - Advanced Features
gh api repos/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx/milestones \
  -f title='v3.3 - Advanced Features' \
  -f due_on='2026-04-01T00:00:00Z' \
  -f description='New features and advanced capabilities'

# v4.0 - Major Update
gh api repos/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx/milestones \
  -f title='v4.0 - Major Update' \
  -f due_on='2026-08-01T00:00:00Z' \
  -f description='Major architectural improvements and new capabilities'
```

---

### Step 3: Create GitHub Project Board (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://github.com/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx/projects
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose "Board" layout
4. Name: "Solar Heating Development"
5. Create these columns:
   - Backlog
   - To Do
   - In Progress
   - Review
   - Testing
   - Done

Or via CLI:
```bash
# Create project (requires GitHub CLI with project permissions)
gh project create --owner DonHugo --title "Solar Heating Development"
```

---

### Step 4: Create Issues (30-60 minutes)

**Recommended Order:**

**Phase A: Start with v3.1 Critical/High Priority (10 issues)**
```bash
# Use the content from ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md
# Create issues via web interface or GitHub CLI
```

**Phase B: Then v3.1 Medium Priority (10 issues)**

**Phase C: Then v3.2 High Priority (10 issues)**

**Phase D: Finally, remaining issues as time permits**

**Note:** See `docs/development/ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md` for full issue content.

---

### Step 5: Configure Project Automation (5 minutes)
1. Go to Project → Settings → Workflows
2. Enable these automations:
   - New issues → Add to Backlog
   - Issue assigned → Move to To Do
   - PR opened → Move to In Progress
   - PR merged → Move to Testing
   - Issue closed → Move to Done

2. @requirements will gather requirements AND create GitHub issue
3. Review and approve
4. Issue is now tracked in GitHub
```

**As Agent:**
```
@requirements:
1. Gather requirements using REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create GitHub issue with:
   - Clear title: [TYPE] Description
   - Complete body from template

4. Routes to @developer
```

### For Tracking Progress

**Weekly Review:**
```
1. Check GitHub Project board

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Labels Not Creating
**Problem:** Script fails to create labels  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated
gh auth login

gh repo view DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx

# Run script again
./scripts/create_github_labels.sh
```

### Can't Create Milestones
**Problem:** API call fails  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Verify repo access
gh api repos/DonHugo/sun_heat_and_ftx

# Try creating via web interface instead
```

### Issue Templates Not Showing
