## ðŸ¤– PART 3: Using Multi-Agent System for Issue Creation

### The Multi-Agent Issue Creation Workflow

When you need to create new issues, use the `@requirements` agent. It will:
1. Gather detailed requirements
2. Create proper acceptance criteria
3. Automatically create GitHub issue
4. Update project tracking

### Example Workflows

#### Workflow 1: New Feature Request

**You say:**
```
@requirements I need to add a notification system that sends alerts 
when the system has errors or when maintenance is needed.
```

**The @requirements agent will:**
1. Ask clarifying questions:
   - What types of notifications? (Email, SMS, push, Home Assistant?)
   - What events trigger notifications?
   - What's the priority of different alerts?
   - Who receives notifications?
2. Document the requirement
3. Create acceptance criteria
4. **Automatically create GitHub issue** with proper labels and milestone
5. Hand off to @architect for design

**What gets created:**
- GitHub Issue #XX: "[FEATURE] Notification System for Alerts"
- Labels: `feature`, `priority: medium`, `component: home-assistant`
- Milestone: Automatically assigned based on priority
- Linked to requirements documentation

---

#### Workflow 2: Bug Report

**You say:**
```
@requirements The energy calculation is showing negative values 
sometimes, and I'm not sure why.
```

**The @requirements agent will:**
1. Ask detailed questions:
   - When does it happen?
   - What sensor values are involved?
   - How frequent is it?
   - What's the expected behavior?
2. Document reproduction steps
3. Define success criteria
4. **Create GitHub issue immediately**
5. Assign appropriate priority based on impact

**What gets created:**
- GitHub Issue #XX: "[BUG] Energy Calculation Shows Negative Values"
- Labels: `bug`, `priority: high`, `component: energy`
- Milestone: `v3.1` (high priority bugs)
- Includes full reproduction steps

---

#### Workflow 3: Enhancement Request

**You say:**
```
@requirements I want to improve the logging system to make it 
easier to debug issues.
```

**The @requirements agent will:**
1. Understand current problems
2. Define desired improvements
3. Create acceptance criteria
4. **Create tracked GitHub issue**
5. Suggest implementation approach

**What gets created:**
- GitHub Issue #XX: "[ENHANCEMENT] Improve Logging for Better Debugging"
- Labels: `enhancement`, `priority: medium`, `component: logging`
- Milestone: Based on priority and dependencies
- Detailed improvement specifications

---

### Integration with Full Development Flow

Once an issue is created, you can continue with the multi-agent workflow:

```
1. @requirements creates issue â†’ GitHub Issue #XX created âœ…

2. @architect designs solution â†’ Adds design docs to issue

3. @tester writes test specs â†’ Links tests to issue

4. @developer implements â†’ References issue in commits

5. @validator validates â†’ Updates issue status

6. Issue closed automatically when merged âœ…
```

---

### Benefits of Multi-Agent Issue Creation

#### 1. **Consistency**
- Every issue has proper structure
- Labels and milestones assigned correctly
- Acceptance criteria always defined

#### 2. **Completeness**
- Requirements gathered before coding
- Edge cases identified early
- Test scenarios defined upfront

#### 3. **Traceability**
- Every feature/bug tracked in GitHub
- Clear link from requirement to implementation
- Easy progress monitoring

#### 4. **Automation**
- No manual issue creation needed
- Proper formatting automatic
- Links and references created automatically

---

### Quick Reference Commands

#### For New Features
```
@requirements I need to add [feature description]

@developer: [Writes code, commits reference issue #45]
```

**Step 5: Validation**
```
You: @validator Validate issue #45

@validator: [Tests, provides hardware validation steps, closes issue when complete]
```

#### Example 2: Quick Bug Fix

```
You: @requirements The pump sometimes runs when it shouldn't, 
     maybe a sensor reading issue?

@requirements: 
- Asks: When does it happen? What sensors? How often?

You: @developer Fix issue #46

@developer:
- Fixes bug
- Makes test pass
- Commits: "Fix pump control logic - closes #46"
- Issue auto-closes when merged âœ…
