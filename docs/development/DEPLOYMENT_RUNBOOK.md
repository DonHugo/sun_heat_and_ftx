**Note:** Skip this for minor changes that support hot reload

```bash
# Stop service
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl stop solar_heating_v3.service"

# Verify stopped
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "systemctl is-active solar_heating_v3.service"
```

Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward
 python/v3/main_system.py | 10 +++++-----
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
```

**If conflicts occur:**
```bash
# Stash local changes
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "cd ~/solar_heating && git stash"

# Pull again

```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Dependencies installed

---

#### Step 3.3: Verify Dependencies
```bash
# Run dependency verification
./scripts/verify_deps.sh
```

**Expected:** All dependencies satisfied

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Dependencies verified

---

### Phase 4: Service Restart & Verification

#### Step 4.1: Restart Service
```bash
# Restart the service
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl restart solar_heating_v3.service"

# Wait for service to initialize
sleep 8
```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Service restarted

---

#### Step 4.2: Verify Service Started
```bash
# Check service status
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl status solar_heating_v3.service --no-pager | head -20"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚óè solar_heating_v3.service - Solar Heating System v3
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/solar_heating_v3.service; enabled)
     Active: active (running) since ...
     Main PID: 12345
     Tasks: 7
```

**If service failed:**
1. Check logs immediately (Step 4.4)
2. Identify error
3. Consider rollback (Phase 6)

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Service running

---

#### Step 4.3: Quick Smoke Tests

##### Test 1: API Responds
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/status | python3 -m json.tool | head -20"
```

**Expected:** Valid JSON with system status

‚úÖ **Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Test 2: Check for Immediate Errors
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo journalctl -u solar_heating_v3.service --since '2 minutes ago' --no-pager | grep -i 'error\|failed\|exception' | head -20"
```

**Expected:** No errors (or only expected/known errors)

‚úÖ **Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Test 3: Core Functionality (if applicable)
```bash
# Test main feature deployed
[Add specific test command for the feature]
```

**Expected:** [Expected behavior]

‚úÖ **Status:** [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL / [ ] N/A

---

#### Step 4.4: Monitor Service Logs
```bash
# Watch logs for 5 minutes
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo journalctl -u solar_heating_v3.service -f"
```

**Watch for:**
- ‚úÖ Normal operation logs
- ‚ùå Error messages
- ‚ùå Warnings
- ‚ùå Unexpected behavior
- ‚ùå Resource issues

**Duration:** Monitor for at least 5 minutes

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Service stable (5 min)

---

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment Verification

#### Step 5.1: Service Health Check
```bash
# Check service is still running
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "systemctl is-active solar_heating_v3.service && echo '‚úÖ Service Running' || echo '‚ùå Service Down'"
```

**Expected:** `‚úÖ Service Running`

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Service healthy

---

#### Step 5.2: Resource Usage Check
```bash
# Check CPU and memory
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "top -b -n 1 | head -20"
```

**Normal Values:**
- **CPU:** < 50% under normal load
- **Memory:** < 500MB
- **No zombie processes**

**If abnormal:** Investigate before declaring success

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Resources normal

---

#### Step 5.3: Extended Monitoring (15-30 minutes)

For critical deployments, monitor for extended period:

```bash
# Monitor logs for 15-30 minutes
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo journalctl -u solar_heating_v3.service -f"
```

**Watch for:**
- Memory leaks (increasing memory over time)
- Repeated errors
- Performance degradation
- Unexpected behavior

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Extended monitoring complete

---

### Phase 6: Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

**Use this procedure if deployment fails or causes issues**

#### Step 6.1: Stop Service
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl stop solar_heating_v3.service"
```

---

#### Step 6.2: Rollback Code
```bash
# Rollback to last known good commit
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "cd ~/solar_heating && git reset --hard <last-good-commit>"

# Verify rollback
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "cd ~/solar_heating && git log --oneline -1"
```

**Rollback to Commit:** `<from Step 1.3>`

---

#### Step 6.3: Rollback Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
# If dependencies were changed, reinstall old versions
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "/opt/solar_heating_v3/bin/pip3 install -r ~/solar_heating/python/v3/requirements.txt --break-system-packages --force-reinstall"
```

---

#### Step 6.4: Restart Service
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl start solar_heating_v3.service"
```

---

#### Step 6.5: Verify Rollback
```bash
# Check service is running with old code
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl status solar_heating_v3.service --no-pager | head -20"
```

---

#### Step 6.6: Document Rollback
**Reason for Rollback:** `_________________`  
**Rolled back to:** `<commit-hash>`  
**Timestamp:** `_________________`

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** [ ] Rollback complete and documented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

**Symptoms:** Service status shows "failed"

**Steps:**
1. Check logs: `ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo journalctl -u solar_heating_v3.service -n 100 --no-pager"`
2. Look for specific error
3. Common causes:
   - Syntax error (run py_compile)
   - Missing dependency
   - Configuration error
   - Hardware access issue

**Solution:** Fix issue or rollback

---

### Syntax Error After Deployment

**Symptoms:** `SyntaxError` in logs

**Immediate Action:** ROLLBACK (Phase 6)

**Prevention:** Always run pre-deployment checklist

---

### Import Error

**Symptoms:** `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`

**Cause:** Missing dependency in production venv

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "/opt/solar_heating_v3/bin/pip3 install <missing-module> --break-system-packages"
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "sudo systemctl restart solar_heating_v3.service"
```

---

### High Resource Usage

**Symptoms:** High CPU or memory usage

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check processes
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "top -b -n 1 | head -30"

# Check for memory leaks
ssh pi@192.168.0.18 "ps aux | grep python3"
```

**Action:** Monitor closely, consider rollback if degrading
